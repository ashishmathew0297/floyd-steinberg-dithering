    abstract="In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for dithering of gray-scale images. Our algorithm is based on the lattice Boltzmann method, a well-established and powerful concept known from computational physics. We describe the method and show the consistency of the new scheme to a partial differential equation. In contrast to widely-used error diffusion methods our lattice Boltzmann model is rotationally invariant by construction. In several experiments on real and synthetic images, we show that our algorithm produces clearly superior results to these methods.",
